# Google Homepage Recreation
This is the first mini-project as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 
## Part 1: "Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage"
### Reflections:
- I tried to go for a mobile-first design strategy, and from what I saw in resizing the browser window on Google's page, the footer is really the section that changes the most (along with the width of the search bar)
- Some of the icons/images aren't exactly the same as Googles
    - The waffle grid for Google apps is slightly different
    - The user profile icon is different, but I think of my version as more of a mockup, and I think it's sufficient in its purpose as that
    - The leaf image in the "Carbon neutral" link seems smaller in Google's version. I saved the image directly from their page, so I'm not sure why the sizing is different, but that's something that can probably be adjusted on the .png file itself
- I used a mixture of Grid and FlexBox for the layout of the page. My original plan was to only use Grid, because that's what I've learned most recently and it's fresher in my  mind. But I struggled with the footer being responsive and re-ordering, so I switched to FlexBox for that section.
- This project was more fun than I had anticipated, and I'm proud of the results so far. On to part 2...

## Part 2: "Difficult Version (optional): Build the [Google.com search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage)"
